## _Hi!_

I'm Uzen, a high school students doing random projects.
From hardware to software, I dabble a little in all kinds of things.
You may find things related to keyboards, Linux, programming, and other things on this website.

Do note that all information is gathered personally.
Although I try to be as accurate as possible, __there may be the change of errors on this website.__ 

You have been warned.
